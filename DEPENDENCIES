We have 1 build dependency:
libgit2, a highly portable git library available on many Unix-likes.

We have 3 runtime dependencies:
libgit2.
OpenSSL, a portable cryptography library. Many systems already have this installed.
PCRE, a portable Perl compatible regex library. Many systems already have this installed.

If you cannot download the dependencies from repositories or build them
we provide binaries under Trotskystation/ss13d-deps. We will have support 
for this in the Makefile. To be documented.

We do not provide OpenSSL or PCRE.
